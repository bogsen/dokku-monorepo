# dokku-monorepo

Dokku plugin for monorepo setups.

This plugin is a fork of the [dokku-monorepo](https://github.com/sebastian/dokku-monorepo) plugin.
This plugin differs from the original in one significant way.
Whereas the original assumes that each sub-directory can be independently deployed,
this version caters to a setup where each directory:

1. Is deployed using `Dockerfile`
2. Need the root folder to be used as the `context` sent to docker in order to access shared folders and files.

## Install

```
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/sebastian/dokku-monorepo
```

## Usage

```
$ ls
.dokku-monorepo
myapp1
myapp2
```

The file .dokku-monorepo contains paths for applications to be deployed:

```
first=myapp1
second=myapp2/backend
```

The part before `=` is used to identify the dokku application. For example, here:

```
$ git remote -v
first             dokku@dokku.me:example-first
first-staging     dokku@dokku.me:example-first-staging
second            dokku@dokku.me:example-second
```

the `example-first` and `example-staging-first` applications would be deployed from the `myapp1` folder.

Each of these app folders should contain a `Dockerfile` that will be copied to the root folder
by this plugin at the time of the deployment.

When you push the code to an application's remote, the folder gets detected for you:

```
$ git push first

It's that easy!
